/*
 * Phase5.1, Step6: a thin native TLS client wrapper over OpenSSL.
 *
 * This wraps an *already-connected* raw TCP socket fd (as produced by
 * myon.net.connect / net_raw_fd) in an OpenSSL TLS session, following the
 * usual OpenSSL client flow:
 *
 *     SSL_CTX_new -> SSL_new -> SSL_set_fd -> SSL_connect
 *     -> SSL_read / SSL_write -> SSL_shutdown -> SSL_free.
 *
 * The interpreter's myon.http.get / myon.http.post use this for https:// URLs.
 *
 * SECURITY NOTE: certificate verification is enabled against the system's
 * default trust store (SSL_CTX_set_default_verify_paths) with SNI-based
 * hostname checking, on a best-effort basis.  It is NOT a hardened TLS stack;
 * do not treat it as a substitute for a reviewed production TLS client.
 *
 * Return-code convention for tls_read / tls_write mirrors net_send/net_recv:
 *     >= 0  bytes transferred (0 from tls_read == clean EOF)
 *     -2    would block (retry after the socket becomes ready)
 *     -1    a real error (*err_msg set to a heap string, caller frees)
 */
