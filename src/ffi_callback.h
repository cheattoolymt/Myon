/*
 * Phase4.1, Step4 — C-to-Myon callbacks (limited).
 *
 * Lets a Myon function value be handed to a C library as a plain function
 * pointer that the library can call back later (e.g. SDL_SetEventFilter).
 *
 * Scope (intentionally narrow, do not widen):
 *   - up to 4 arguments, each int64 / pointer class only (no double args);
 *   - the return value is int64 only (a void-returning callback simply ignores
 *     the returned value);
 *   - a small fixed number of live callbacks at a time (MYON_FFI_CB_SLOTS).
 *
 * Design: libffi closures are NOT used (to avoid a new dependency).  Instead a
 * fixed grid of static C trampoline functions — one per (slot, arg-count)
 * combination — is compiled ahead of time.  Each trampoline knows its own slot
 * index at compile time, looks up the Myon function value registered in that
 * slot, and invokes it via the interpreter's call_function().  Single-threaded
 * use is assumed (Myon runs single-threaded).

 *
 * On success returns the raw C function pointer to hand to a C call (pass it as
 * a 'p' argument — carried as an int address on the Myon side).  Returns NULL
