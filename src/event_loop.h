/*
 * Phase5, Step1: a single-threaded, cooperative event loop.
 *
 * This module is deliberately independent of the interpreter's value system:
 * it knows nothing about `Value`, `Obj`, or refcounts.  Tasks carry an opaque
 * `void *result` that interpreter.c casts to/from `Value *`.
 *
 * The implementation uses POSIX `ucontext.h` (makecontext/swapcontext) to give
 * each task its own C stack so the tree-walking interpreter's recursive
 * eval_expr/exec_stmt do not need any changes: a task simply runs on its own
 * stack and, at an `await` / I/O point, swaps back to the loop, preserving its
 * whole C call stack until it is resumed.
 *
 * Platform support mirrors the FFI subsystem's "Linux is the primary target"
 * policy: ucontext is available on Linux glibc.  On platforms lacking it the
 * module compiles as an unsupported stub.
